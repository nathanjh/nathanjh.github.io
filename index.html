		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>Flirting with a long-defunt service road, this historic route from the Pacific Ocean to the Santa Ynez valley winds relatively quickly up to the Romero Saddle.  On its way, passing through lush, shaded riparian and oak woodlands up into the sandstone-studded high chaparral along the crest of the Santa Ynez mountains.</p>
